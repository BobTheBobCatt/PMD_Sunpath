# Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Sunpath
PMD: Sunpath is a story mod for [PMDO](https://github.com/audinowho/PMDODump/) created by BobTheBobCatt that aims to create a full-length adventure featured on the Sand Continent of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.
It currently consists of 0 chapters. - NOTE: This is very much an early WIP.

## To install and play
1. [Download and install PMDO](https://github.com/audinowho/PMDODump/releases) if you have not already.
2. Download PMD: Sunpath as a zip file from PMDO's Discord server (not available there right now.) The latest release should be the most stable one.
3. Extract the PMD: Sunpath zip file to its own folder.
4. Place extracted PMD: Sunpath folder into PMDO's MODS folder. The exact file path changes depending on where you put PMDO, but it should go something like PMDO/MODS/PMD_Sunpath in the end.
5. Make sure PMD: Sunpath is not embedded an extra folder down! When you click on Sunpath's folder in your MODS folder, it should have the readme file in plain sight, and not in another folder.
6. Start PMDO, and select PMD: Sunpath from the main menu via Special Episodes.

If you're having trouble installing the game, or have any questions, comments, feedback, etc., please join the [PMDO discord](https://discord.gg/37VKndMsr2) and talk with BobTheBobCatt (me) or any dev there! The dedicated channel for PMD: Sunpath discussion is in the Sunpath tab (once it's made).



## FAQ
1. How come the map is not accurate to the Sand Continent in Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon?
* The Sand Continent in PSMD is not really that utilized; Most places lack a unique theme and many names leave a lot to be desired. I also didn't want to draw too heavily on the game, especially given the previous statement. As for the major changes like the lowering of the snowline, that was purely my headcanon; I know PMD itself struggles with sensible snowlines. Also, the Sand Continent doesn't have a lot of biome diversity in PMDO.

2. How come some of the music is...different?
* Some tracks I used are from other titles; This is not an original thing to this project as PMDO also does the same thing. Honestly, I knew I was taking a gamble by using some tracks from other game series. If these tracks sound too out of place, then I'll change the tracks to something else.

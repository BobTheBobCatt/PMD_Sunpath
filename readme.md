# Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Sunpath
PMD: Sunpath is a story mod for [PMDO](https://github.com/audinowho/PMDODump/) created by BobTheBobCatt (aka, me) that aims to create a full-length adventure featured on the Sand Continent of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.
It currently consists of 0 chapters. - NOTE: This is very much an early WIP.

## To install and play
1. [Download and install PMDO.](https://github.com/audinowho/PMDODump/releases)
2. Download PMD: Sunpath as a zip file from [its own GitHub page.](https://github.com/BobTheBobCatt/PMD_Sunpath)
3. Extract the PMD: Sunpath zip file to its own folder.
4. Place extracted PMD: Sunpath folder into PMDO's MODS folder. The exact file path changes depending on where you put PMDO, but it should go something like this: PMDO/MODS/PMD_Sunpath
5. Make sure PMD: Sunpath is not embedded an extra folder down. When you click on Sunpath's folder in your MODS folder, it should have the readme & mod file in plain sight, and not in another folder.
6. Start PMDO, and select PMD: Sunpath from the main menu via Special Episodes.

If you are having any issues with installation of the mod or have any questions regarding it, you can join the [PMDO Discord server](https://discord.gg/37VKndMsr2) and ask me or any devs there.



## FAQ
1. How come the map is not accurate to the Sand Continent in Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon?
* The Sand Continent in PSMD is not really that utilized; Most places lack a unique theme and many names leave a lot to be desired. I also didn't want to draw too heavily on the game, especially given the previous statement. As for the major changes like the lowering of the snowline, that was purely my headcanon; I know PMD itself struggles with sensible snowlines. Also, the Sand Continent doesn't have a lot of biome diversity in PSMD.

2. How come some of the music is...different?
* Some tracks I used are from other titles; This is not an original thing to this project as PMDO also does the same thing. Honestly, I knew I was taking a gamble by using some tracks from other game series. If these tracks sound too out of place, then I'll change the tracks to something else.
